				<h3>Viva Musica Academy</h3>
				<p>As a music teacher at Viva Musica Academy, I was reponsible for teaching students of all ages to play the piano and violin, as well as
				teaching music theory. I often draw on the analytical and creative skills I acquired during my time at Viva Musica to inform my developer habits.
				For example, my I would often need to break down complex ideas to a step-by-step solution for my students, similar to how a program is simply
				a set of step-by-step instructions of a complex task a computer needs to accomplish.
				<br /><br /> Aside from the analytical skills, I learned how to communicate with people from all walks of life during my time as a teacher - communicating with
				parents to set goals for their children's musical education, to representing the studio at public engagement events and encouraging others to pursue a 
				music journey </p>
